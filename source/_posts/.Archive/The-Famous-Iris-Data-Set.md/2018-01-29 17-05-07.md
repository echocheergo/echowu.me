# The Famous Iris Data Set
This is the first blog where I write about my journey of becoming a data scientist. Today we'll talk about how we can analyze and visualize the famous Iris dataset.

> The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

The Iris dataset is commonly used as a "introductory" dataset for evaluating various data analysis techniques such as SVM, KNN, decision tree, etc. In this post, different measures are taken to visualize the dataset and perform multi-class classification on it.

## Get the data
The first thing I want to do is get the data and take a look at how it distributes. To do this, conveniently, 
```python

```
